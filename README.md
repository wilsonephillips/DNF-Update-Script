## DNF-Update-Script
Just a simple update script with some color codes for OpenMandriva Rock or ROME

Path ~/.local/bin/update.sh and make it executable

Call it with an alias from ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_alias
alias dsync='~/.local/bin/update.sh'

Running the script creates ~/dsync2.txt

It's rice for the sake of rice.
