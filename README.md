## DNF-Update-Script
Just a simple update script with some color codes for OpenMandriva Rock or ROME

Path `~/.local/bin/update.sh` and make it executable

Call it with an alias from `~/.bashrc`
`alias dsync='~/.local/bin/update.sh'`

Running the script creates `~/dsync2.txt`

It's rice for the sake of rice!

The instructions are documented in the script as well for easy reference. In fact, there is far more documentation than script. It is all about getting newbies interested in bash and the terminal.
